It can have a significant impact on potato crop yield, and it can spread rapidly under favorable conditions. The name \"Late Blight\" comes from its tendency to become a serious problem in the late growing season.\n\nWhen the model predicts a disease like this with 53.37% confidence, it suggests that based on the provided data or symptoms observed, it's more likely than not that the plant has Late Blight. However, it's not a certainty, and other diseases could potentially present similar symptoms. \n\nFor managing Late Blight, consider the following strategies:\n\n**1. Fungicides:** Apply specifically-targeted fungicides to combat P. Infestans. A regular spray programme should be initiated following the manufacturer's instructions, such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based options. \n\n**2. Resistant Varieties:** Where possible, plant resistant varieties of potatoes. This non-chemical approach can be a significant help in reducing problems with Late Blight. They may not be 100% resistant, but they can often greatly lower the severity of disease impact.\n\n**3. Good agriculture practice:** Maintain proper spacing between potato plants to enhance ventilation and prevent spread. Also, dispose of infected plants promptly and safely to avoid further contamination.\n\n**4. Monitoring weather:** Since this disease is favored by specific weather conditions (cool and humid), monitoring weather and applying fungicides ahead of favorable disease conditions can help manage Late Blight.  \n\nHowever, keep in mind that constant monitoring and adaptive strategies are required to manage this disease. If it continues or appears to worsen, reach out to local agricultural extension services for further advice. In some cases, laboratory testing may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.", "timestamp": "2025-05-22 10:07:55.933787"}]}, "64544caf-b33d-405a-a7aa-569bf9b90ca5": {"chat_id": "64544caf-b33d-405a-a7aa-569bf9b90ca5", "user": "makanga.christopher3", "title": "New Chat", "created_at": "2025-05-22 10:06:35.813582", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello", "timestamp": "2025-05-22 10:06:48.521161"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!
